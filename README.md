# About

This is a 2D game written in C# using Unity3D game engine.

The project was made in August 2020 and was published in the App Store and Google Play.

All the code is written by me, all the sprites are drawn by me, as well as audio, music, animations, idea, game design and everything else.

At the moment, it can be downloaded to your android device via the link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vladimirkulikov.fairbomber
